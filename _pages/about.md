I'm a graduate student working at Michigan State. I work on some of this really cool stuff: 

Evolutionary swarm robotics 
======
I recently received the [NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) to study the impacts of different substrates and selection schemes on the evolution of swarms. This work is ongoing, but will hopefully be published soon. Supported by [MABE](https://github.com/Hintzelab/MABE) and with help from [Clifford Bohm](https://cliffbohm.weebly.com/).

The ecology–evolution continuum and the origin of life
======
Since I started my PhD, I've been working with [Emily Dolson](https://cse.msu.edu/~dolsonem/), [Sydney Leither](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BzcWiSgAAAAJ&hl=en), and the [Baum lab](https://baumlab.botany.wisc.edu/) to investigate pre-genetic adaptive change. While the Baum lab does some super interesting lab work, I work on the comutational side, modeling systems that could be representative of the eraly interactions of pre-biotic chemicals. A great in depth summary of this framework can be found in *The ecology–evolution continuum and the origin of life* by Baum et al. 2023.

Emergence and Information Theory
======
Working with Clifford Bohm and Vincint Ragusa, we're developing a new theory of emergence. This paper might eventually see the light of day.
